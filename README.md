## Introduction
The Vestas Demo project is a testament to the transformative power of renewable energy. Through cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions, we have harnessed the potential of React, Tailwind CSS, and various icon libraries to create a dynamic and visually stunning web application.

### Key Features 
* **React:** The application is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library, providing a solid foundation for developing the web application with its component-based architecture.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, is utilized for efficient and responsive styling. It ensures a consistent and visually appealing user interface by providing a wide range of utility classes.
* **Icon Libraries:** Various icon libraries, including react-icons and @iconscout/react-unicons-solid, are integrated into the project to enhance the visual presentation and provide intuitive navigation options.
* **Modular and Reusable Components:** The code showcases the implementation of modular and reusable components, adhering to best practices for maintainability and extensibility. This approach promotes code reusability and simplifies future enhancements.


## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository using the following command <br>
```git clone https://github.com/shahzada-shah/vestas-demo.git``` <br><br>
2. Navigate to the project directory  <br>
```cd renewable-services``` <br><br>
3. Install the required dependencies <br>
```npm install``` <br><br>
4. Start the development server <br>
```npm start```

## Future Updates or Improvements
* **Navigation Items with Their Own Routes:** Implement additional navigation items with their own routes using React Router DOM. This will allow for seamless navigation between different sections or pages of the application, enhancing user exploration and content discovery.
* **Career Filter Search:**  Integrate a career filter search functionality to enable users to easily search and filter available career opportunities based on specific criteria such as job title, location, or job type. This will improve the user experience and help users find relevant job listings efficiently.
* **Turbine Filter:**  Implement a turbine filter feature that allows users to search and filter Vestas' wide range of turbines based on specific parameters such as capacity, rotor diameter, or technology type. This will assist users in finding turbines that align with their project requirements and facilitate informed decision-making.
